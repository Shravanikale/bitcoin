## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable models to predict Bitcoin prices over different time horizons.
## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data
## What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Building the machine learning model.
-Prepared data for modeling by imputing missing values and scaling features for analysis.


## Library used:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. plotly 
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn
6. sklearn

## Conclusion:

- Data is loaded and explored for Bitcoin price analysis.
- Relationships are visualized through histograms and scatter plots.
- Missing data is addressed and basic imputation is applied.
- Data is prepared for future modeling or analysis tasks.
